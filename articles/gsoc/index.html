<p> It was 10pm on 23rd April, the result was due at 12:30 on the 24th. I was anxious and restless, so i decided to go for a movie. Every 5 mins i would pull down my inbox to refresh it, when after some time i decided to just chuck it. It was 12:30, all of my friends desperately waiting for the result, everyone staring at the screen. The result was out but damn the website obviously had to crash at this moment. Sumanah came to my rescue pointing me to the blog post announcing the GSoC students for Wikimedia Foundation. My name was there…

</p>
<p>It was a surreal feeling, i jumped with joy, hugged everybody. One of my friends Ashish had also been selected for the Wikimedia Foundation. The next thing i knew was that i was driving to pick him up from the hostel and then going back to my home to surprise my dad. I was happy, i was excited and everyone around was happy…

<h3>Open Source dots</h3>
<p>I got introduced to open source in the winters of 2008, in an IEEE open source workshop organized by my seniors. It was at this time that i got involved with the JIIT-LUG ( now knows as OSDC ), which had really cool people doing amazing stuff in the field of open source. Other than being active in the community and attending few small meetups, I really was not contributing anything to the open source community or any open source project. Then we organized the OSSCamp in our university, where people from across the country had come, and I realized just how big the open source community in India is. It was a great event, and it really pushed me to start coding and to get involved with an open source community. Few months later, i organized a Firefox 4 Launch party, where we had a weekend hackathon on building Firefox extensions. We contributed 8 extensions in that weekend, one being developed by me and my friend.

<h3>The merge</h3>
<p>Few months ago, I got involved with the Wikimedia Foundation to start contributing to it through the GSoC program. I must say that its an amazing community with very friendly people. Usually, newcomers like me are a bit scared/reluctant in talking to the community, but this feeling went away in the first interaction i had with the community. The then volunteer development Co-ordinator Sumanah Harihareswara has been really helpful in guiding us in the right direction, and clearing our doubts (which usually are very stupid).

</p>
<p>I decided to work on the Upload Wizard project, mainly because it best matched my skill sets. I have always had  a fascinated for Javascript, the language really intrigues me and since this project was almost entirely written in Javascript, I really enjoyed just reading the code and learning from it. As I dived more into the code, i realized how wonderfully it was written and how much i had to learn before putting in some code of the same level. With this motivation, I started solving bugs and improving my coding along the way.

</p>
<p>My first patch was merged on 16th April 2012 and although it was a very small patch, but this was my first patch that got merged and i did not have that guilt anymore of not contributing to an open source project.

</p>
<h3>The Summer Ahead …</h3>
<p>Few months ago, i had no idea what i was doing this summers. Fast forward today, and this is proving to be the best summer ever. I ll be working on the GSoC project, which in itself is gonna be very exciting and a hell of a ride. Next i am going to Germany for the Wikimedia Berlin Hackathon and i am really looking forward to meet the community members. I am sure i am gonna learn from them a lot, and hacking alongside them is gonna be so much fun. Also i ll be going to Zurich to attend the Django Conference, again meeting some really awesome people and learning a lot. Not to mention that Berlin and Zurich are truly beautiful cities to be in. Its like a HULK-SMASH summer for me.
