						I got selected in Google Summer of Code program under The Wikimedia Foundation. It’s an amazing feeling and I am very happy the way things turned out to be.

					<h3>The Organization</h3>

					<p>
						I chose to work for <a href="http://www.wikimedia.org/">The Wikimedia Foundation</a>. I simply love The Wikimedia Foundation's idea of free knowledge sharing for one and all. Its an amazing community with very friendly people. I never felt I was new to this community.

					<h3>The Project</h3>

					<p>
						I chose to work on <a href="https://github.com/wikimedia/jquery.ime">jQuery.IME project</a>. jQuery.IME is a jQuery based input method editor library supporting more than 155 input methods across more than 50 languages. It allows you to write in more than 50 languages using the default keyboard layout.
					</p>
					<p>
						I chose this project because I have always had a fascination for Javascript and since this project was almost entirely written in Javascript, I knew I would love to hack around it.
						My project mainly aims at:
						<ul>
							<li>
								Porting jQuery.IME to browser extensions (Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome)	
							</li>
							<li>
								Making some improvements in the library such as adding an on-screen keyboard feature and support for contenteditable divs	
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						As of now jQuery.IME is provided from the Wikimedia servers. Hence it is only available in Wikimedia projects such as <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> and <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a>.
						The motive behind this WMF project is to provide language technology tools to a wider audience outside the Wikimedia universe. Porting it completely to the client side, in the form of browser extensions, would enable its usage on any website across the web. It would allow users to type in their native language on any website using the same default keyboard layout. For example, one can do a google search in, say, Hindi language.
					</p>

					<h3>The journey so far</h3>

					<p>
						Its already been two months since I started working on this project. The mid-term evaluation is just around the corner and I have made some considerable progress. I have to say that I'm very lucky to have <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/User:Sthottingal">Santhosh Thottingal</a> and <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:Aaharoni">Amir E. Aharoni</a> as my mentors. They have always helped me out whenever I got stuck somewhere.
					</p>

					<p>
						So far we have implemented working jquery.ime extensions for both Chrome and Firefox. Rather than loading all input methods at once, input method scripts are loaded only when the user selects a particular input method. We added <a href="https://github.com/wikimedia/jquery.ime">jQuery.IME</a> and <a href="https://github.com/wikimedia/jquery.uls">jQuery.ULS</a> upstream projects as git submodules in the extensions. This would provide a way to synchronize the extensions with the upstream projects in future by simply updating the respective submodule.
					</p>

					<p>
						We have successfully integrated Universal Language Selector in the extensions which provides the user an easy way to choose among different languages. The extension remembers a user's most recently selected languages and their corresponding input methods and provides an easy way to choose among those languages. IME preferences are stored in extension's local storage. We implemented helpHandler for IME the same way it is implemented in Universal Language Selector in Wikipedia. It provides a <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Extension:UniversalLanguageSelector/Input_methods">help link for the selected input method</a>.
					</p>

					<p><a href="https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=49569">Support for contenteditable div</a> was implemented by the Language Engineering Team since it became one of the top priorities of the team. I had to simply synchronize the extensions with the upstream project in order to add contenteditable support to the extensions.</p>

					<h3>jQuery.IME extensions in action</h3>

					<h3>Looking forward …</h3>

					<p>
						If everything goes well, I will launch beta versions of both Chrome and Firefox on their respective webstores. Some user feedback would help a lot in improving usability and overall functionality of the extensions. Up next I would start working towards implementing the on-screen keyboard feature. I'd be discussing the visual layout with Pau Giner, Wikimedia's Interaction Designer, for the same. This is proving to be one my best summers, and I am very excited about it.
