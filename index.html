					<h3>The Organization</h3>

					<p>
						I chose to work for <a href="http://www.wikimedia.org/">The Wikimedia Foundation</a>. I simply love The Wikimedia Foundation's idea of free knowledge sharing for one and all. Its an amazing community with very friendly people. I never felt I was new to this community.
					</p>
					<h3>The Project</h3>

					<p>
						I chose to work on <a href="https://github.com/wikimedia/jquery.ime">jQuery.IME project</a> mainly because it best matched my skill-set. I have always had  a fascination for Javascript and since this project was almost entirely written in Javascript, I knew I would love to hack around it. jQuery.IME is a jQuery based input method editor library supporting more than 155 input methods across more than 50 languages. It provides multilingual input support across several Wikimedia projects. As of now jQuery.IME is provided from the Wikimedia servers. Hence it is only available in Wikimedia projects. My project mainly aims at:
						<br>
						~ Porting jQuery.IME to Firefox and Chrome extensions
						<br>
						~ Adding an on-screen keyboard feature
						<br>
						~ Support for contenteditable divs
