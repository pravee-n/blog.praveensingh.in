<p>Again, you can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.

<p>Inspiration is best felt when seen through your the image left behind from your own experiences. Quite often we find ourselves doing what we don’t love, for people who don’t matter and for results which we don’t care about. Its a great illusion of following a “safe path” casted by the so called Education System which does very little of what it is supposed to do. Subdued by the deliverables, one stops listening to his heart and ends up becoming just another traveller on a road that does not lead anywhere. Very few people really know that there exists a choice, and even fewer take the choice. Once you make the choice, Its all about trusting in yourself, not the results, not the world, not the system but just yourself and move forward. See the world how you see it, and not how the world tells you to see it. Once you know what you want, and the only thing that you follow is your heart then there is nothing that can stop you other than your own heart. The world then is centered at you and you control it, you suddenly become the person who is at the center and not an observer in the corner.

<h3>Wandering</h3>
<p>When I entered college, I was clueless of what I wanted to do. I really had not started searching for it, so I started wandering. <strong>Wandering </strong>is a process once explained to me by my friend – In simple words you keep looking till you find what you were really looking for.

</p>
<p>Only thing different between wandering and treasure hunt is that in treasure hunt you know it all along what you are looking for, but in wandering you don’t know what you are looking for and neither do you know where it exists. There is just this feeling inside that tells you that it exists. For some people, wandering is only for a second, they find out what they really want to do in an instant while others take years ( Read flipsyde ). I took 3 years to find out the thing I really loved to do, and like they say  ” I can do every second of my life and never regret it.”

<h3>The dots left behind …</h3>
<p>Its only when I look back now that I can see the dots connecting. I used to draw Cartoons when i was 12, then loved doing sketching when I was 16. As I grew, I got interested in making simple games using C++, then i got introduced to GIMP and boom, the next i remember was that I was doing GIMP almost all the time. From GIMP I moved onto making games using game engines, OpenGL etc, I really enjoyed it !

</p>
<p>I got introduced to web development when I was 20, and really loved the huge potential it had for an individual to explore. I was making websites, but I did not enjoy it after some time, somehow I could not imagine myself doing it for the rest of my life. It was at this time that I started reading about User Experience, and it fascinated me a lot.

</p>
<p>I have been studying UX since, and absolutely love each moment I learn more about it. Somehow there is no moment in my life when i can say no to anything related to UX.

</p>
<p>I got selected for GSoC and would be working for The Wikimedia Foundation. Its only now when I look behind that I can see that the dots connect, that I know that each dot has its place and holds it importance. There are still a lot of dots to come, but what ever they would be, I know that they would connect as long as I am following my heart.

        <section class="content"><p>I got selected in Google Summer of Code program under The Wikimedia Foundation. It’s an amazing feeling and i really can’t describe it in a few words.

</p>

<p> It was 10pm on 23rd April, the result was due at 12:30 on the 24th. I was anxious and restless, so i decided to go for a movie. Every 5 mins i would pull down my inbox to refresh it, when after some time i decided to just chuck it. It was 12:30, all of my friends desperately waiting for the result, everyone staring at the screen. The result was out but damn the website obviously had to crash at this moment. Sumanah came to my rescue pointing me to the blog post announcing the GSoC students for Wikimedia Foundation. My name was there…

</p>
<p>It was a surreal feeling, i jumped with joy, hugged everybody. One of my friends Ashish had also been selected for the Wikimedia Foundation. The next thing i knew was that i was driving to pick him up from the hostel and then going back to my home to surprise my dad. I was happy, i was excited and everyone around was happy…

</p>
<h3>Open Source dots</h3>
<p>I got introduced to open source in the winters of 2008, in an IEEE open source workshop organized by my seniors. It was at this time that i got involved with the JIIT-LUG ( now knows as OSDC ), which had really cool people doing amazing stuff in the field of open source. Other than being active in the community and attending few small meetups, I really was not contributing anything to the open source community or any open source project. Then we organized the OSSCamp in our university, where people from across the country had come, and I realized just how big the open source community in India is. It was a great event, and it really pushed me to start coding and to get involved with an open source community. Few months later, i organized a Firefox 4 Launch party, where we had a weekend hackathon on building Firefox extensions. We contributed 8 extensions in that weekend, one being developed by me and my friend.

</p>
<h3>The merge</h3>
<p>Few months ago, I got involved with the Wikimedia Foundation to start contributing to it through the GSoC program. I must say that its an amazing community with very friendly people. Usually, newcomers like me are a bit scared/reluctant in talking to the community, but this feeling went away in the first interaction i had with the community. The then volunteer development Co-ordinator Sumanah Harihareswara has been really helpful in guiding us in the right direction, and clearing our doubts (which usually are very stupid).

</p>
<p>I decided to work on the Upload Wizard project, mainly because it best matched my skill sets. I have always had  a fascinated for Javascript, the language really intrigues me and since this project was almost entirely written in Javascript, I really enjoyed just reading the code and learning from it. As I dived more into the code, i realized how wonderfully it was written and how much i had to learn before putting in some code of the same level. With this motivation, I started solving bugs and improving my coding along the way.

</p>
<p>My first patch was merged on 16th April 2012 and although it was a very small patch, but this was my first patch that got merged and i did not have that guilt anymore of not contributing to an open source project.

</p>
<h3>The Summer Ahead …</h3>
<p>Few months ago, i had no idea what i was doing this summers. Fast forward today, and this is proving to be the best summer ever. I ll be working on the GSoC project, which in itself is gonna be very exciting and a hell of a ride. Next i am going to Germany for the Wikimedia Berlin Hackathon and i am really looking forward to meet the community members. I am sure i am gonna learn from them a lot, and hacking alongside them is gonna be so much fun. Also i ll be going to Zurich to attend the Django Conference, again meeting some really awesome people and learning a lot. Not to mention that Berlin and Zurich are truly beautiful cities to be in. Its like a HULK-SMASH summer for me.

</p>
<p> After repetitive attempts, i finally start my own blog and aim to stick to blogging. I have been reading a lot of good practices, tips, tricks and suggestions..yada dada… i start this journey of blogging.

</p>
<p>I would be sharing my experiences and things that amuse me, like its said that a blog is an extension of you.

</p>
<p>There are two more motivations i have for blogging, one is a new French Press Coffee Maker my friend Sandhya gifted me and another is continuing my work on  my wordpress theme – Slidle which is used in this blog.
